    **Everyone**:

    This week, we will review [system calls], which are the interfaces through
    which user applications can request services from the operating system
    kernel.  Instead of manipulating data directly on a hard drive or directly
    controlling a CPU, we use the **abstractions** of a *file* and *process* to
    perform our desired actions.  The OS *virtualizes* the physical resources
    of a hard drive and a CPU and allows us to access these *virtual* objects
    through [system calls] such as [open] and [fork].

    These abstractions make it easier for us to program large applications by
    hiding the low-level details of interacting with hardware and by allowing
    our programs to be portable to different machines.  Of course, with any
    layer of abstraction there is some **trade-off**, and this week we will
    examine how operating systems virtualize the CPU via [processes] and how
    the operating system provides [time sharing], different forms of
    [multitasking], and what happens during a [context switch].

    #### <i class="fa fa-search"></i> TL;DR

    For this reading assignment, you are to review basic [system calls] related
    to [processes], submit your responses to the [Reading 02 Quiz], and write a
    program that uses basic [file] system calls.

    ## Program

    For this week's program, you are to modify the `program.c` to implement a
    basic version of the [sha1sum] utility:

    > Usage: program [file1 file2 ...]
    >
    > For each argument given to `program`, compute the [SHA1] digest of
    > the contents of each file argument and display it.

    The purpose of this exercise is for you to review using basic I/O [system
    calls] such as [open], [read], and [close].  If you need a refresher, please
    read [Files and
    Directories](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-intro.pdf) from the
    course textbook.

    ### Example

        :::bash
        $ ./program Makefile  # Compute SHA1 of Makefile
        e0b1114fd6dc86b34c1e3c7bf3a9f71757c55cae  Makefile

        $ echo $?             # Check exit status
        0

        $ ./program asdf      # Handle invalid files

        $ echo $?             # Check exit status
        1

    ### Requirements

    - Your program must compile cleanly with no warnings.

    - Your program may only use I/O system calls such as [open], [read], and
      [close] to access the contents of each file.

    - Your program must use [stat] to get the size of any files.

    - Your program must use the [SHA1()] function provided by [OpenSSL].

    - Your program must not have any resource leaks or memory errors as
      detected by [valgrind].

    ### Hints

    To help you get started, the instructor suggests you review the suggestions
    from [Generate SHA hash in C++ using OpenSSL
    library](https://stackoverflow.com/a/919375) [StackOverflow] post and this
    **FAQ** slide.

    <div class="thumbnail">
      <img src="static/img/reading02-sha1sum.png" class="img-responsive">
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
    #### <i class="fa fa-bomb"></i> Error Checking

    Make sure you always perform **error checking** for [system calls] (ie.
    [stat]) and functions (ie. [malloc]) that could fail.
    </div>

    Note, we are interested in computing the [SHA1] digest.

    <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
    #### <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> OpenSSL Deprecation

    Note that in [OpenSSL] 3.0, the `SHA1_Init`, `SHA1_Update`, and
    `SHA1_Final` functions are deprecated and you should instead use the `SHA1`
    function to compute the raw [SHA1] digest of a buffer of bytes.
    </div>

    You will want your code to be structured in the following manner:

        :::text
        function sha1sum_file(path: string, cksum: string) -> bool:
            Open file for reading

            Stat file to get meta-data (ie. file length)

            Allocate data buffer with enough space for length of file

            Read data from file into data buffer

            Compute raw SHA1 digest of data in buffer

            Convert raw SHA1 digest into hexadecimal digest

            Close file

            Deallocate data buffer

        function main(arguments):
            For each argument:
                Compute hexadecimal SHA1 Digest using sha1sum_file
                Display hexadecimal SHA1 Digest

    <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
    **Note**: To link properly to the [SHA1] function, you will need to add
      `-lcrypto` to the `LIBS` variable in your `Makefile`.
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
    **Note**: You will want to return `0` if all arguments were able to be processed
    successfully.  Otherwise, return the **number of files that failed** as the
    **exit status**.
    </div>
