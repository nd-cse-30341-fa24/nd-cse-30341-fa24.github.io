    **Everyone**:

    Next week, we will explore how an OS provides **persistence** by managing
    [I/O devices] such as [hard disks].  Likewise, we will also consider
    aggregation strategies such as [RAID] which provide an illusion of a large
    disk composed of multiple inexpensive disks.

    #### <i class="fa fa-search"></i> TL;DR

    For this reading assignment, you are to read about [I/O devices] and
    [RAID], and submit your responses to the [Reading 10 Quiz].

    ## Reading

    The readings for this week are:

    1. [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces]

        - <p>[Dialogue on Persistence](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/dialogue-persistence.pdf)</p>
        - <p>[I/O Devices](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-devices.pdf)</p>
        - <p>[Hard Disk Drives](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-disks.pdf)</p>
        - <p>[Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-raid.pdf)</p>
        - <p>[Flash-based SSDs](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-ssd.pdf)</p>

    ### Optional Reading

    - [An Introduction to RAID Terminology and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-raid-terminology-and-concepts)

    - [Understanding RAID: How performance scales from one disk to eight](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/understanding-raid-how-performance-scales-from-one-disk-to-eight/)

    ### Optional Conversation

    Using [Learn About from Google], have a conversation about [I/O devices]
    and [RAID] by asking the following questions:

    > 1. What is the memory hierarchy?
    > 2. How do operating systems provide persistence?
    > 3. What is the difference between a SSD and a HDD?
    > 4. What is RAID and why is it useful?
    > 5. What is the difference between RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, and RAID 10?

    As you explore, feel free to dive into the suggested related
    questions or to "simplify", "go deeper", and "get images".

    ## Quiz

    Once you have done the readings, answer the following [Reading 10 Quiz]
    questions:

    <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

    <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

    <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>
    <script>
    loadQuiz('static/json/reading10.json');
    </script>

    ### Program

    For this week, you are to explore the filesystems on
    **student10.cse.nd.edu** by using [df], [lsblk], [mount], [stat], and
    `/proc/mdstat` to answer the following questions:

    1. What device is the root (ie. `/`) filesystem mounted on (ie. `/dev/XXX`)?

    2. What type of filesystem is `/boot` mounted on?

    3. What version of [RAID] does `/home` use (ie. `raidX`)?

    4. How large is each **swap** partition (in `G` units)?

    5. What is the **inode** number of `/etc/hosts`?

    6. What is the file size (in bytes) of `/bin/ls`)?

    In your `program.c`, simply use puts to print out the answers:

        :::c
        int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
            puts("/dev/...");
            ...
            puts("1");
            return 0;
        }
